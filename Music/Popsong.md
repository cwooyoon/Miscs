I Have A Dream - ABBA
가사
I have a dream a song to sing 
To help me cope with anything 
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale 
You can take the future even if you fail 
I believe in angels 
Something good in everything I see 
I believe in angels 
When I know the time is right for me 
I`ll cross the stream I have a dream 

I have a dream, a fantasy 
To help me through reality 
And my destination makes it worth the while 
Pushing through the darkness still another mile 
I believe in angels 
Something good in everything I see 
I believe in angels 
When I know the time is right for me 
I`ll cross the stream I have a dream 
I`ll cross the stream I have a dream 

I have a dream a song to sing 
To help me cope with anything 
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale 
You can take the future even if you fail 
I believe in angels 
Something good in everything I see 
I believe in angels 
When I know the time is right for me 
I`ll cross the stream I have a dream 
I`ll cross the stream I have a dream

```
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up... To more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up... To more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up... To more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders

You raise me up... To more than I can be
You raise me up... To more than I can be
```
